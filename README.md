# orbi

orbi is a n-body simulation built to simulate the evolution of various solar systems in 2d.

#

This repository is just a sample of some of the code I wrote.

the Particle file contains whats nessesary for each particle
the System file which I should probably rename contains the functions for particle-particle interactions which is currently using cpu multithreading though I've been tring with limited success to incorperate Opencl and gpu processing.
then the mainwindow file deals with the user interface.
